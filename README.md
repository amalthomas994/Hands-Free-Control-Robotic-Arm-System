# Hands-Free-Control-Robotic-Arm-System
The purpose of this project was to design and build a hands-free control system for a multi-
purpose robotic arm which is analogous to a human arm. To give the arm functionalities of a
human arm, multiple sensors were implemented into the robotic arm such as sensors which will
read the temperature of items it is holding and sensors to regulate the pressure it applies to those
items while trying to grip them. This essentially gives the robotic arm a sense of feel. Just like a real
arm, the robotic arm can perform multiple tasks like picking up a cup, opening doors, and
manipulating objects.

The robotic arm can be used in a variety of situations where it will enable users to perform
tasks as if it was a real functioning arm. For the robotic arm to be used by all types of users, a
hands-free control system consisting of a SNP (Sip Nâ€™ Puff) device and a 6-axis IMU will be
employed. To receive feedback from the system, an LCD screen was implemented to display
information from the temperature sensors and other additional sensors. For more feedback, an
audio feedback system was also added to the design.
